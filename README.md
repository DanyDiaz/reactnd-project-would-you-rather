# Would You Rather?

## Description

This is a webapp that lets a user play the "Would you rather?" game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

The users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they have not answered yet, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

## Project setup

To start using the web app you just have to:

* Clone this repository with this command: `git clone https://github.com/DanyDiaz/reactnd-project-would-you-rather.git`
* Enter the main directory (cd reactnd-project-would-you-rather)
* Inside the directory install all project dependencies with `npm install` (Be patient it can take several minutes)
* Start using the site with `npm start`. The web app will appear automatically in your browser (http://localhost:3000)
